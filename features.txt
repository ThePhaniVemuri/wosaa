1. JWT Auth (fixed + polished)
Access + Refresh token system
Auto refresh flow on frontend
Logout route clears refresh token from DB
Role-based auth: client, freelancer, admin

2. Freelancer & Client Dashboard
Give BOTH sides a dashboard:
Freelancer Dashboard
List of available gigs
Gig search + filters: price, category, tech stack
Apply/claim task
Task history
Client Dashboard
Post gig form
My gigs
Status: open, in-progress, completed
Manage payments
Why: Shows multi-role UI + backend experience.

3. Payments (Stripe / Razorpay)
For micro-transactions like $0.99–$3.99.
Client pays → Freelancers get virtual credits
No need to do real withdrawals (for now)
Just store “earnings” for each freelancer
Why: Payments = instant 10x project value.

4. Task Workflow (MOST IMPORTANT)
Gig lifecycle:
open → assigned → submitted → approved → completed
Features:
Freelancer marks task “submitted”
Client reviews & approves
Auto credit money to freelancer Wallet
Simple chat under each task
Why: Interviewers LOVE workflow + state machines.

5. Real-Time Notifications (Socket.io)
Examples:
“Your task was approved!”
“New gig posted: React bug fixing”
