MERN SaaS Project Review: "wosaa"
1. Authentication & Authorization Review
Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented / Flawed

JWT Authentication: ✅ Implemented. Uses Access (short-lived) and Refresh (long-lived) tokens.
Refresh Token Rotation: ✅ Implemented. Generates new pair on refresh.
Flaw: No reuse detection. If an old refresh token is used, it just fails, but doesn't invalidate the family of tokens (security best practice).
Flaw: Raw refresh tokens are stored in the database (user.refreshToken). If the DB is compromised, attackers can hijack sessions. Should be hashed.
Limitation: Single-session only. Logging in on a new device invalidates the previous device because it overwrites the single refreshToken field.
Auto Token Refresh: ✅ Implemented in Frontend (
refreshAccessToken.js
).
Flaw: Inconsistent usage. 
postGig.js
 and 
applyToGig.js
 use 
fetch
 directly, bypassing the auto-refresh logic. Users will face random failures when their access token expires.
Logout: ✅ Implemented. Clears cookie and DB token.
Role-Based Authorization: ⚠️ Weak.
Missing: No explicit RBAC middleware (e.g., verifyRole(['client'])).
Flaw: Controllers rely on implicit checks (e.g., Client.findOne({ userId })). A Client could technically call Freelancer endpoints if they have a valid token, and vice versa, leading to potential logical errors or 404s instead of 403s.
Protected Routes: ✅ Implemented using verifyJWT.
2. Freelancer & Client Dashboard Evaluation
Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented

Freelancer Dashboard:
✅ View available gigs.
✅ Apply to gigs.
✅ View "Gigs in work".
❌ MISSING: Search & Filter (price, category, tech stack). The backend showGigs returns ALL gigs without filtering.
❌ MISSING: Task history (past completed gigs). Only shows current active gigs.
Client Dashboard:
✅ Post gig.
✅ View "My gigs" and applicants.
✅ Hire freelancer.
✅ Track status (can manually set status).
Architecture:
API Design: Poor. showGigs fetches all gigs with no pagination. This will crash the browser/server as the DB grows.
State Handling: Basic React state. No global state management (Redux/Zustand) for complex flows, but UserContext handles auth well.
UI: Decent separation, but 
Dashboard.jsx
 is a monolith handling both roles. Should be split into ClientDashboard and FreelancerDashboard.
3. Payments System Review
Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented

Payment Intent: ✅ Implemented using dodopayments.
Webhook Verification: ✅ Implemented using @dodopayments/express library.
Credit Flow: ❌ MISSING.
There is no "Wallet" or "Balance" in the 
User
 model.
Money goes to the platform's Dodo account. The system tracks Contract payment status, but there is no code to "release" funds to a freelancer's virtual wallet or payout method.
Idempotency: ❌ MISSING.
Webhook handler does not check if the event was already processed. Duplicate webhooks will trigger duplicate DB updates (though addToSet mitigates some damage).
4. Task Workflow & State Machine
Status: ⚠️ Flawed

Gig Lifecycle: Open → In Progress → Completed.
State Transitions: ❌ Weak.
Client can manually set ANY status via setGigStatus. They could theoretically set an open gig to completed immediately.
MISSING: "Submitted" state. Freelancers cannot mark work as done. Only the client controls the status.
Transaction Safety: Basic. No database transactions (sessions) used for multi-document updates (e.g., updating Contract, Gig, Client, and Freelancer simultaneously in webhook). If one fails, data becomes inconsistent.
5. Real-Time Features
Status: ❌ Critical Issues

Socket.io: ✅ Setup exists.
Authentication: ❌ CRITICAL MISSING.
chatServer.js
 does NOT verify the user. Any connection is accepted.
join-room: Anyone can join any room. No check if the user is part of the contract.
send-message: Trusts the sender ID sent from the client. A malicious user can spoof messages from anyone.
Notifications: ❌ MISSING.
No real-time notifications for "Gig Approved" or "New Gig". Only chat messages are real-time.
6. Security Audit
Status: 🔴 Critical Risks

Sensitive Data Exposure:
🔴 
user.controller.js
: Logs plain text password (console.log(password)).
🔴 
dodoWebhook.js
: Logs webhook secret.
🟠 
client.controller.js
: Logs full req.body.
Rate Limiting: ❌ MISSING. No express-rate-limit. Vulnerable to brute-force and DoS.
NoSQL Injection: ⚠️ No sanitization middleware (mongo-sanitize).
Security Headers: ❌ MISSING (helmet).
Environment: ✅ 
.env
 is gitignored.
7. Deployment Readiness
Status: 🟠 Not Ready

Build: Backend has no build step (okay for simple Node), but Frontend needs npm run build.
Config: Hardcoded URLs in frontend (http://localhost:3000). Should use env vars.
Scalability:
showGigs fetches entire DB collection. Will fail under load.
No DB indexing defined in schemas (except unique: true for email).
CI/CD: None.
8. Resume Worthiness Verdict
Verdict: Intermediate (Student Level)

Is it resume-worthy? Yes, but only if fixed. As it stands, the security flaws (password logging, no socket auth) and architectural gaps (no pagination, missing wallet) would be "red flags" in a senior review. It shows you can build features, but lack production awareness.

Level Signal:

Current: Junior / Intern (promising but raw).
Potential: Strong Junior / Early Intermediate.
What to Highlight:

Full-stack MERN implementation.
Integration with 3rd party payments (Dodo).
Real-time chat implementation (mention Socket.io).
What to Fix Before Applying (Mandatory):

REMOVE CONSOLE LOGS: Delete the password and secret logging immediately.
Fix Socket Auth: Implement socket.use middleware to verify JWT before allowing connection/messages.
Pagination: Implement .limit(10).skip(page * 10) in showGigs.
Frontend Auth: Use 
fetchWithRefresh
 consistently across ALL API calls.
3 Upgrades to make it "Interview-Proof":

Robust State Machine: Implement a proper state machine (using a library or strict logic) that prevents invalid transitions (e.g., cannot go Open -> Completed). Add a "Submitted" state for freelancers.
Transactions: Use MongoDB Sessions (startSession) for the webhook and hiring logic to ensure data consistency.
Advanced Filtering: Add backend support for filtering by Category, Budget Range, and Search Text.
